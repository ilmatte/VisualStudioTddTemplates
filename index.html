 <h1>TDD Project and Item Templates (for Visual Studio 2015)</h1>
 <hr/>
If you’ve been using ‘NUnit’ you found yourself involved in doing repetitive actions like creating test projects
and adding test classes and test methods. 
If you ever had a try with the ‘Rhino Mocks’ mocking framework you had an extra bit of repetitive code to write, 
in all of your TestFixture classes.

I was tired of always creating a new test project for each project in my solution and manually add references. 
I was tired of always prepare test classes with Setup and Teardown methods as well as other standard elements.

Then I created a standard Project Template creating a test class library, 
an Item Template creating a Rhino Mocks enabled TestFixture class, and a couple of useful code snippets.

All this stuff is targeted to Visual C# projects and documented <a href="readme.html" target="blank">here</a>

</div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
function _dmBootstrap(file) {
    var _dma = document.createElement('script');
    _dma.type = 'text/javascript';
    _dma.async = true;
    _dma.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://' : 'http://') + file;
    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(_dma);
}
function _dmFollowup(file) { if (typeof DMAds === 'undefined') _dmBootstrap('cdn2.DeveloperMedia.com/a.min.js'); }
(function () { _dmBootstrap('cdn1.DeveloperMedia.com/a.min.js'); setTimeout(_dmFollowup, 2000); })();
</script>
</body>
